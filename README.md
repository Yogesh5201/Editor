Live Code Editor – Front-End Web Project
This repository contains our front-end project Live Code Editor, developed as part of our coursework. It is our first-year mini project,
and we have uploaded it here as part of the subject Source Code Management (SCM).

📌 Project Overview
Live Code Editor is a static website designed to provide users with an online platform to write, test, and edit code in real-time. It includes multiple pages such as:

– Home Page

– Login Page

– Try Now Page

– About Us Page

– Contact Us Page

– Pricing Page

– FAQ Page

The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive and user-friendly, with a clean layout and smooth navigation.

🤝 Team Effort
This website was created by a team of three members as part of our learning experience. All members contributed to different parts of the website, 
and we collaborated using GitHub to manage our source code, track changes, and stay updated with each other's work.
